Oracle SQL statements with errors and poor formatting

1.

3.

-- eventno can be qualified with either eventrequest or eventplan table

5.
-- Original statement with poor coding practices
-- Poor clause and condition alignment
-- Incompatible constant in WHERE condition: estaudience = '10000'

-- Rewritten statement with improved coding practices
-- Should align clauses and conditions
-- Numeric constant in WHERE condition: estaudience = 10000
