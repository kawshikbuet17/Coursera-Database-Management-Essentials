4.	The first solution is preferred because it involves one less table. However, I will also give credit for the second answer as it involves different join operations.

-- Condition using default date format
SELECT eventplan.planno, lineno, locname, resname, numberfld, timestart, timeend
FROM facility, eventplan, eventplanline, resourcetbl, location
WHERE eventplan.workdate BETWEEN '1-Oct-2018' AND '31-Dec-2018' 
  AND eventplan.planno = eventplanline.planno AND location.facno = facility.facno
  AND facname = 'Basketball arena' AND eventplanline.resno = resourcetbl.resno
  AND location.locno = eventplanline.locno 
  AND eventplan.activity = 'Operation';

-- Condition using to_date function
SELECT eventplan.planno, lineno, locname, resname, numberfld, timestart, timeend
FROM facility, eventplan, eventplanline, resourcetbl, location
WHERE eventplan.workdate BETWEEN to_date('10/1/2018','mm/dd/yyyy') AND to_date('12/31/2018','mm/dd/yyyy')
  AND eventplan.planno = eventplanline.planno AND location.facno = facility.facno
  AND facname = 'Basketball arena' AND eventplanline.resno = resourcetbl.resno
  AND location.locno = eventplanline.locno 
  AND eventplan.activity = 'Operation';

-- Condition using to_date function and join operator style
SELECT eventplan.planno, lineno, locname, resname, numberfld, timestart, timeend
FROM eventrequest, facility, eventplan, eventplanline, resourcetbl, location
WHERE eventplan.workdate BETWEEN to_date('10/1/2018','mm/dd/yyyy') AND to_date('12/31/2018','mm/dd/yyyy')
  AND eventplan.planno = eventplanline.planno AND eventrequest.facno = facility.facno
  AND facname = 'Basketball arena' AND eventplanline.resno = resourcetbl.resno
  AND eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno

Database Modification Answers

1.	
INSERT INTO Facility ( FacNo, FacName )
VALUES ('F107', 'Swimming Pool');

2.	
INSERT INTO Location ( LocNo, FacNo, LocName )
VALUES ('L107', 'F107', 'Door');

3.	
INSERT INTO Location ( LocNo, FacNo, LocName )
VALUES ('L108', 'F107', 'Locker Room');

Oracle SQL statements with errors and poor formatting

1.

  AND facname = 'Football stadium' 
  AND empname = 'Mary Manager';

-- Corrected statement

-- Rewritten statement with improved coding practices
-- Note: many ways to reformat the statement
-- Should align clauses and conditions
-- Numeric constant in WHERE condition: estaudience = 10000
